# üöÄ Hierarchical Permission System Migration Guide

## Overview
This migration adds a comprehensive hierarchical role and permission system to the RestaurantIQ backend. The system supports 5-level role hierarchy with granular permissions and secure role assignment rules.

## üìã Pre-Migration Checklist

### ‚úÖ Environment Requirements
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] PostgreSQL database running
- [ ] Database connection configured in `.env`
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful (`npm run type-check`)

### ‚úÖ Database Backup
- [ ] Create full database backup
- [ ] Verify backup is restorable
- [ ] Document current user count and role distribution
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedure

### ‚úÖ System State
- [ ] Stop all application instances
- [ ] Disable user registration endpoints
- [ ] Notify users of planned maintenance
- [ ] Verify no active sessions will be affected

## üèóÔ∏è Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Generate Prisma client with new schema
npm run db:generate

# 2. Create database backup
npm run db:backup

# 3. Validate current data structure
npm run test  # Run existing tests
```

### Phase 2: Migration Execution (30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Run the comprehensive migration script
npm run db:migrate:permissions

# 2. Monitor migration progress (check logs)
tail -f logs/migration.log

# 3. Verify migration completed successfully
# The script will show:
#   - Data backup completed
#   - Database migration completed
#   - 40+ permissions created
#   - Role permissions synced
#   - Existing users migrated
#   - All validations passed
```

### Phase 3: Validation (20 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Run permission system tests
ts-node scripts/test-permissions.ts

# 2. Verify database structure
npm run db:studio

# 3. Check permission counts in database
# Expected results:
#   - permissions table: 40+ records
#   - role_permissions table: 100+ records
#   - All users have security fields
```

## üîç Post-Migration Verification

### Database Structure Validation
```sql
-- Check permission tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM permissions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM role_permissions;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_permissions;

-- Verify user security fields
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE failed_login_attempts IS NULL;
SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;
```

### API Endpoint Testing
```bash
# Test authentication with new system
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password","restaurantId":"restaurant-1"}'

# Test user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"new@example.com","password":"NewPass123!","firstName":"New","lastName":"User","restaurantId":"restaurant-1"}'

# Test role assignment (as OWNER)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/v1/restaurants/restaurant-1/users/user-id/role \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"MANAGER"}'
```

## üîÑ Rollback Procedure

### If Migration Fails
```bash
# 1. Stop the migration script (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Run rollback script
ts-node scripts/rollback-permissions.ts

# 3. Restore from backup
# Follow your database backup restoration procedure

# 4. Verify rollback success
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM permissions;  -- Should be 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM role_permissions;  -- Should be 0
```

### Manual Rollback Steps
```sql
-- Remove permission-related data
DELETE FROM role_permissions;
DELETE FROM user_permissions;
DELETE FROM password_resets;
DELETE FROM permissions;

-- Reset user security fields
UPDATE users SET
  failed_login_attempts = 0,
  locked_until = NULL,
  password = NULL,
  assigned_by_id = NULL;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Migration script fails with permission errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure database user has full permissions
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE restaurantiq TO your_user;
```

#### Issue: TypeScript compilation errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Regenerate Prisma client
npm run db:generate
```

#### Issue: Permission service not found in container
**Solution:**
- Verify container configuration in `src/config/container.ts`
- Check that `PermissionService` and `PasswordService` are registered
- Restart application after container changes

#### Issue: Password validation fails
**Solution:**
- Check password strength requirements in `PasswordService`
- Verify bcrypt is properly installed
- Test password hashing manually

### Performance Considerations
- New permission checks add ~10-20ms to request processing
- Consider caching user permissions for high-traffic endpoints
- Monitor database query performance with permission joins

## üìä Migration Impact

### Database Changes
- **New Tables:** 3 (permissions, role_permissions, user_permissions, password_resets)
- **Modified Tables:** 1 (users - added security fields)
- **Indexes:** 6 new indexes for performance
- **Storage Impact:** ~1MB for permission data + 1KB per user

### API Changes
- **New Endpoints:** 8 authentication and user management endpoints
- **Enhanced Security:** JWT tokens now include permissions
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing role-based checks still work

### Performance Impact
- **Authentication:** +20-30ms (permission loading)
- **Authorization:** +5-10ms (permission checking)
- **Database:** Minimal impact with proper indexing

## üöÄ Post-Migration Tasks

### Immediate (Next Day)
- [ ] Enable user registration endpoints
- [ ] Monitor application logs for errors
- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Verify role assignment functionality

### Short Term (Week 1)
- [ ] Update frontend to use new authentication system
- [ ] Implement permission-based UI components
- [ ] Add role management interface
- [ ] Create user onboarding documentation

### Long Term (Month 1)
- [ ] Implement permission caching
- [ ] Add permission audit logging
- [ ] Create permission management UI
- [ ] Add advanced permission features

## üìû Support

### If Issues Occur
1. Check migration logs in `logs/migration.log`
2. Verify database connection and permissions
3. Test individual components in isolation
4. Contact development team with error details

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Check migration status
npm run db:studio

# View permission data
SELECT name, category, action FROM permissions LIMIT 10;

# Check user permissions
SELECT u.email, u.role, COUNT(up.id) as permission_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_permissions up ON u.id = up.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.role;
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] Migration script completes without errors
- [ ] All permission system tests pass
- [ ] Authentication endpoints functional
- [ ] Role assignment working correctly
- [ ] No existing functionality broken
- [ ] Database performance acceptable
